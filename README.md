Stupid script that'll compare 2 teams across 2 different ESPN leagues. 

## Configuration
 - Edit config/settings.ini with appropriate values. They should be self explanatory. Also, make sure your ESPN
    league is set to be viewable by the public, or this absolutely won't work.

## Installation
 - Run ./composer.phar install
